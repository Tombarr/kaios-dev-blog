## JioPhone (India)

![JioPhone](https://www.jio.com/jpv_2020_frontdefaultimage.png "JioPhone")

**The [JioPhone](https://www.jio.com/en-in/jiophone) is effectively the #1 (and only) choice for users in India**. All JioPhone feature phones, including the BlackBerry-like [JioPhone 2](https://www.jio.com/en-in/jiophone2), are SIM-locked to Reliance Jio's network. However, many can have DevTools enabled and get root access. For instance, Qualcomm models can have a custom ROM flashed using the QFIL Tool.

The JioPhone has over [20+ models](https://www.sites.google.com/view/bananahackers/devices/jio-phone) with various design tweaks and chipsets. As of April 2023, the only models for sale are the F320B, aka the "JioPhone Value", which **does not include Wi-Fi**, and the difficult to find F300B, aka the JioPhone 2. Depending on your needs, you may need to look after market for a used JioPhone model.

The [Nokia 8110 4G](https://amzn.to/3MuzHRr), aka the "Banana Phone" or the "Matrix Phone" is iconic, easily-recognizable, and **one of the best options for developers**. That's because it is [easily unlocked](https://sites.google.com/view/bananahackers/devices/nokia-8110-4g) to enable DevTools simply by dialing the code `*#*#33284#*#*`. You can also get root access by sideloading [Wallace Toolbox](https://gitlab.com/suborg/wallace-toolbox), enable Unrestricted DevTools, unlock the bootloader, flash custom ROMs, and more.

<u>Note</u>: there is a variant of the [Nokia 8110 4G for Jio in India](https://sites.google.com/view/bananahackers/devices/nokia-8110-4g#h.p_GKW0ss4JLCFh), but it's difficult to find, and it more locked down than the International variant.

## Flagship KaiOS 3.0 Devices (US only)

### [Alcatel Go Flip 4](https://amzn.to/3nYQ1je) (T-Mobile)

![Alcatel Go Flip 4](https://images.alcatelonetouch.us/products/phones/goflip4/carousel.jpg "Alcatel Go Flip 4")

The [Alcatel Go Flip 4](https://amzn.to/3nYQ1je) was one of the debug KaiOS 3.0 devices in the US. It's carrier-locked to the T-Mobile network, although it can be unlocked after 180 days of continuous use. The GF4 is a **great choice for seniors** because it is simple to use, has large tacile buttons, and offers a smoother experience than older KaiOS 2.5 phones. The GF4 is the successor of the [Alcatel Go Flip 3](https://amzn.to/3UqUTd5), which was Unlocked and KaiOS 2.5. Both are very similar in size and form factor, but the GF4 has better internals and runs a more modern version of KaiOS.

![TCL Flip Pro](https://www.tcl.com/usca/content/dam/tcl/product/mobile/tcl-flip-pro/carousel-/1.jpg "TCL FLip Pro")

The [TCL Flip Pro](https://amzn.to/3MwBPIA) is the Verizon counterpart to the Alcatel Go Flip 4, as one of the debug KaiOS 3.0 flip phones in the US. Similar to the GF4, the TCL Flip Pro is also a **good choice for seniors and digital detoxers** because of its ease of use and smooth performance.

## Nokia Flip Phones

### [Nokia 2720 Flip](https://amzn.to/40X4DhM) (Unlocked)

![Nokia 2720 Flip](https://images.ctfassets.net/wcfotm6rrl7u/46t1iw0e8JLTAG2pSj6YjZ/3449e7139caa70a1612e5dd462ff4be7/nokia_2720_Flip-DTC-ClassicFlip-desktop.png?w=881&h=956&fm=avif&q=88 "Nokia 2720 Flip")

The [Nokia 2720 Flip](https://amzn.to/40X4DhM) is **one of the best KaiOS devices for usability**, due to its large keys and display, features like screenshots using key combos `*` + `#`, dedicated volume buttons, Google Assistant, and ability to [enable DevTools](https://www.sites.google.com/view/bananahackers/devices/debug-enabled?authuser=0#h.odnt8edhjsmk) (on certain OS versions). It runs KaiOS 2.5.2, has a long battery life, and comes Unlocked for use on any GSM carrier.

For under $30, it's hard to beat the [Nokia 2760 Flip](https://amzn.to/3GwPwTP). There are several variants, and all are locked to budget pre-paid carriers like Total by Verizon and [Tracfone](https://amzn.to/3ZOzETH). That said, they comes with a 5MP camera, 1.3GHz Quad-Core CPU, 4-32GB storage, Wi-Fi, and KaiOS 3.1. Because it is so affordable and feature rich, the Nokia 2760 Flip is a **great choice for digital detoxers and first time KaiOS users** in the US.

### [Nokia 2780 Flip](https://amzn.to/3zKzDFy) (Unlocked, Flip)

![Nokia 2780 Flip](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/MEDIAX_849526-T1/images/I/61RiO719umL._AC_SX679_.jpg "Nokia 2780 Flip")

The [Nokia 2780](https://amzn.to/3zKzDFy) is an unlocked flip phone running KaiOS 3.1 that works on T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T. It is almost indistinguishable from the Nokia 2760 Flip in appearance, except the **Nokia 2780 is not carrier locked**. There are [side-by-side comparisons of the Nokia 2760 and 2780](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vavRT1XRj_k) if you'd like to learn more.

### [Nokia 6300 4G](https://amzn.to/3ZTM0ty) (Unlocked, Candybar)

The [Nokia 6300 4G](https://amzn.to/3ZTM0ty) is popular for its candybar form factor. Like most Nokia's, it comes Unlocked for use on all GSM carriers and works as a Wi-Fi Hotspot. It also runs KaiOS 2.5.4, one of the more modern sub-versions of the operating system.

## Rugged Phones

### [Nokia 800 Tough](https://amzn.to/416yCn0)

![Nokia 800 Tough](https://images.ctfassets.net/wcfotm6rrl7u/1dE9ATAMBlEYSrXheDTvXa/c554b0186e7a5b8bd1889eb361b13f6d/nokia_800-DURABILITY_1-desktop.jpg?w=894&h=835&fm=avif&q=88 "Nokia 800 Tough")

The [Nokia 800 Tough](https://amzn.to/416yCn0) is a rugged device running KaiOS 2.5.2. Unless [updated to KaiOS 2.5.2.2](https://www.sites.google.com/view/bananahackers/devices/debug-enabled?authuser=0#h.uz9hfmeg6ml7), it can be rooted and is one of the most rugged KaiOS phones on the market. That said, the battery is not removable and some users have complained about the small button size.

### [CAT B35](https://amzn.to/3GvXf4D)

![CAT B35](https://www.kaiostech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/CAT-B35-01.jpg "CAT B35")

Similar to the Nokia 800 tough, the [CAT B35](https://amzn.to/3GvXf4D) is a rugged KaiOS phone. The Developer menu cannot be accessed using the [W2D method](https://w2d.bananahackers.net/) I discovered, instead it is more complicated and requires flashing via Qualcomm's [EDL Mode](https://areille.com/blog/hacking-cat-b35-developer-options-adb/). The B35 is drop proof, dust proof, and waterproof, comes pre-installed with Google Assistant, and runs KaiOS 2.5.1.

<sup>1</sup> <u>Note</u>: All JioPhone models except the JioPhone Value (F320B) include WiFi.<br />
<sup>2</sup> <u>Note</u>: **KaiOS 3.0+ devices are US-only** and do not allow DevTools and have not been rooted as of April 2023.

<hr />

With two major KaiOS versions (2.5 and 3.0), several methods for accessing DevTools and root, and dozens of devices to choose from, it's difficult to know what KaiOS phone is right for you. Here I have summarized popular choices, with some background to guide your decision. Generally speaking, Nokia is the top choice for developers since devices made by HMD Global allow easy access to DevTools (except for KaiOS 3.0+ devices).
