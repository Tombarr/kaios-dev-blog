**Reliance Jio might be replacing it's [KaiOS](https://kaiostech.com/) flagship, the [JioPhone](https://www.jio.com/en-in/jiophone), with the more budget-friendly [Jio Bharat 4G V2](https://www.jio.com/jcms/jiobharat/).**

**Why it matters?** Reliance Jio's [JioPhone](https://www.jio.com/en-in/jiophone) represents the vast majority of [KaiOS](https://kaiostech.com/) devices globally. The latest model, the JioPhone Value, was released in Fall 2021. Back in 2019, [more than 70 million JioPhones](https://telecomtalk.info/reliance-jio-sold-70million-jiophones/221418/) had been sold. Two years later in 2021, KaiOS announced that it had surpassed [150 million KaiOS-enabled devices](https://www.kaiostech.com/storms-and-kaios-technologies-bring-fruit-ninja-and-jetpack-joyride-to-150-million-kaios-enabled-devices/).

By my estimates, the JioPhone still makes up well over half of all active KaiOS devices today. At **Rs 999 ($12 USD)**, the lower-end [Jio Bharat 4G V2](https://www.jio.com/jcms/jiobharat/) might replace the JioPhone in Jio's lineup, designed for the **250 million Indian consumers** transitioning from 2G to 4G.

## About the Jio Bharat 4G

While it's predecessor the JioPhone is a **smart feature phone** running KaiOS, the Jio Bharat 4G is a basic 4G feature phone running a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). It comes with the following specifications:

* 1.77-inch VGA screen
* HD calling and Voice over LTE (VoLTE)
* Front and rear 0.3 MP cameras
* 1000 mAh battery
* Pre-installed with apps including
  * JioSaavn (Music)
  * JioCinema
  * JioPay with Unified Payments Interface (UPI)
* Supports 23 languages

Alongside the Jio Bharat 4G, Jio announced new plans includnig 14GB of data and unlimited voice calls for Rs 123 ($1.5 USD) for a month or Rs 1,234 ($15) for a year. This positions the Jio Bharat 4G below similar 2G competitors, making it an attractive option for the hundreds of millions of feature phone users.

## What's next for KaiOS?

Earlier this year, KaiOS announced a string of partnerships for subsidy locks and device financing designed to [drive adoption across Africa]({{< ref "whats-next-kaios" >}}). Although the 100M+ JioPhones sold in India won't just disappear, Jio has effectively undercut their flagship device and over time India's ccontribution to KaiOS demographics will continue to decrease.
