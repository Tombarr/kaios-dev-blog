[KaiOS.dev](https://kaios.dev) is written by [Tom Barrasso](https://barrasso.me). Previously the Head of Developer Relations at [Cloud Phone](https://developer.cloudphone.tech/), Tom helped many developers bring modern digital services to affordable mobile devices. Tom has developed for feature phones since early 2020, learning by experience how to design, build, and scale the best experiences on budget devices aimed at serving the next billion internet users.

Tom is the founder and developer of [PodLP](https://podlp.com), the first and most popular podcast app for KaiOS and Cloud Phone. PodLP surpassed 10M+ installs around the world and was a [2020 KaiOS Staff Pick](https://www.kaiostech.com/2020-most-popular-kaios-apps/). It is available for free on the [KaiStore](https://www.kaiostech.com/store/apps/?bundle_id=com.podlp.podlp), JioStore, and Cloud Phone.

**KaiOS**, built on top of Firefox OS, allows developers to build scaled-down web applications that run on low-end phones, most of which are equipped with 4G, Wi-Fi, 240x320 non-touch screens, D-pad navigation, a T9 keyboard, and VGA camera. This format is perfect for simple applications and classic arcade games. With less than 2,000 total applications and games available, it's much easy to stand out on the KaiStore than on the Google Play Store for Android or the App Store for iOS.

**Cloud Phone**, a remote browser based on [Puffin](https://www.puffin.com/), serves as an app store for budget 4G feature phones that run a real-time operating system (RTOS) like Mocor by Unisoc. Thanks to server-side rendering, Cloud Phone is an easy development target as there is no need for optimizations or costly refactors. With over [100+ devices](https://developer.cloudfone.com/device/), Cloud Phones come in all shapes and sizes but typically sport small QVGA (240x320) or QQVGA (128x160) screens, D-pad navigation, and a T9 keyboard. With about 100 total applications and games, it's easy to get organic traffic and make an impact on the lives of millions.
